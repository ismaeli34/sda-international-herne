  At Miracle Center Church International e.V, being a member is more than just having a certified membership document that can help during the marriage, funeral, education, child dedications and emergencies.

  In MCCI, we believe in Jesus; and as a church, we commit to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Learn the Word of God</b>
  </li>
  <li> <b>Worship Him</b>
  </li>
  <li> <b>Follow His teaching and</b>
  </li>
  <li> <b> Fellowship and grow with other members</b>
  </li>
</ul>

<p  class="justify-text">  When you decide to become a member, you reaffirm your commitment not just to God but also to the church and in this way are accountable to the commitment, fellowship and belonging.
  We the members work together as one family, to support one another; through constant encouragement, motivation, guidance, development and most importantly, through sharing the love of Jesus.

  The difference between attending a Church or being its member can be summed up in one word – COMMITMENT (commitment to serve).
  The more like Christ you are willing to become, the more you will be committed to serve. Being like Christ means you will be more faithful to your commitment and service to God (through the Church).
  Church membership identifies our family of believers who can be counted on, in our attempt to fulfill Gods purpose in our lives.
